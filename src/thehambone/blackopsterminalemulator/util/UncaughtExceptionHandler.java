/**
 * An {@code UncaughtExceptionHandler} is effectively responsible for catching
 * unexpected exceptions. This particular uncaught exception handler will do the
 * following when an unchecked exception is thrown:
 *     1) Log the error to the console.
 *     2) Attempt to write details about the current state of the program to a
 *        file (crash dump).
 *     3) Display an error message to alert the user that a fatal exception has
 *        occurred.
 *     4) Exit the JVM with a nonzero exit code.
